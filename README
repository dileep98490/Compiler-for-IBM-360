Hello, I am @dileep98490This is a two pass compiler, actually assembler for IBM-360. It was a computer of IBM in the 60'sThe Input.txt are the commands, which are to be translated by the AssemblerOutput.txt is the output of pass-1 and Output2.txt is the finaloutput which contains pseudo machine codeThe Checking.c is the one I used, for testing the binary files MOT.DIL and ST.DIL. These are the machine and symbol tables repectivelyThe Assembler.c is the code for assembler. MOTcreation.c for creating the machine ops. I didn't have time, otherwise I would have replaced the op's in Output.txt with the corresponding hex codes from MOT.DILThe rest were object files of the corresponding C-codes
